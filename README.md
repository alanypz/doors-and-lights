# README #

This is an Node.js based API with Express and Johnny-five modules installed to integrate Mobile and desktop application and the raspberry pi controller.
With the application, the client will be able to controll all doors and lights. The main reason for this project is for the safety of the employees. 
Currently the employees need to run to close the doors in the event of rain, and that can cause accidents, also if they are in a hurry, they can end
up damaging the door mechanism. for the lights, this application simplify their work by lowering the lights closer to the workspace and they dont need to 
manually lower or raise them.
